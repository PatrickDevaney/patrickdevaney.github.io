I am a Computer Science PhD student researching geometry processing at the University of British Columbia, supervised by {{< staticref "https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~sheffa/" "newtab" >}}Alla Sheffer{{< /staticref >}}.

Previously, I completed a MSc in Computer Science specializing in computational geometry at the University of Windsor, supervised by {{< staticref "https://cglab.ca/~biniaz/" "newtab" >}}Ahmad Biniaz{{< /staticref >}} and {{< staticref "https://jitbose.ca/" "newtab" >}}Jit Bose{{< /staticref >}}. Prior to this, I completed undergraduate degrees in Mathematics and Computer Science with a minor in Statistics, also at the University of Windsor.

My {{< staticref "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s_number" "newtab" >}}Erdős number{{< /staticref >}} is at most 3 (via Erdős-Aronov-Bose-Devaney or Erdős-Shallit-Biniaz-Devaney).

Outside of academics, I enjoy reading, yoga, and nature photography.
